            When you first arrive at the website, you can make an account or log in with an email, Google 
            Account, or GitHub account—implemented with the Auth0. Once you have a user account, 
            you can enter information like your age, height, and weight to personalize your 
            experience on our website. This data is saved and secured with Auth0.

            Healthy Heroes allows users to enter their information such as age, weight, and height to get a 
            personalized workout and diet plan. However, what's special about these plans is that they are 
            tailored to get you into the physique of your chosen hero. You can also ask your selected hero 
            any question, and they'll respond with a response fitting for that hero.

            Our web application is built on Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python. The front end was 
            built using HTML and JavaScript, wrapped with Bootstrap CSS. We used the Python backend to make 
            calls to the OpenAI API for the generated diet, workout, hero description and chat responses. 
            Additionally, we also used the Auth0 API to easily have authenticated user accounts with saved 
            user information. Finally, we used JavaScript and jQuery to make calls to the Python backend 
            and bring the backend data to the front end and vice versa.
